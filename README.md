# Hello World! üåè
Hi there!üëã, my name is **Vidyasagar Yadav**.  
And this is the **first repository** that i have created, to embark on a journey of learning and practicing **Git** &amp; **Github** along with it's functions and features.

# Git & GitHub Workflow üìö‚ú®üåê

## 1. Clone the Repository üíæ‚ú®üåç

To start working on a project, clone the repository from GitHub to your local machine.

```
git clone <repo-url>
```

## 2. Create a New Branch üå≥‚ú®üîß

Before making changes, create a new branch to keep your work separate from the main branch.

```
git checkout -b <branch-name>  # Creates and switches to a new branch
git branch <branch-name>        # Creates a new branch
git checkout <branch-name>      # Switches to the newly created branch
```

Alternatively, you can use:

```
git branch -c <branch-name>     # Creates a new branch and copies the current branch's history
```

## 3. Work on Your Branch üìöüåø‚ú®

Make your changes, then stage and commit them.

```
git add .                       # Stages all changes in the current directory
git commit -m "commit message"  # Commits the staged changes with a descriptive message
```

Use these additional commands if needed:

```
git status                      # Shows the status of the working directory
git diff                        # Shows the differences between the working directory and the index
```

## 4. Push Your Branch to Remote Repository üåêüì¢‚ú®

Push your branch to the remote repository to share your changes.

```
git push -u origin <branch-name>  # Pushes the branch and sets the upstream reference
```

## 5. Create a Pull Request on GitHub üîßüìöüåü

Go to GitHub, navigate to your repository, and create a pull request to propose your changes for review.

## 6. Review and Merge üí°üåøüîÑ

After the pull request is reviewed and approved, merge it into the main branch on GitHub.

## 7. Update Your Local Repository (main branch) üåêüîßüåø

Keep your local main branch up-to-date with the remote repository.

```
git switch main                 # Switches to the main branch
git pull origin main            # Pulls the latest changes from the remote main branch
```

Alternatively, you can use:

```
git checkout main               # Switches to the main branch
git fetch origin                # Fetches changes from the remote repository
git merge origin/main           # Merges the fetched changes into the main branch
```

## Interactive Rebase üåµ

Interactive Rebase is a tool for optimizing and cleaning up your commit history. It's like a swiss-army knife for git operations.
It can help peform various operations:
 - Change a commit's message.
 - Delete commits.
 - Reorder commits,
 - Squash: Combine multiple commits into one.
 - Edit/split an existing commit into mutliple new ones.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning:** Do NOT use Interactive Rebase on commits that you have already pushed/shared on a remote repository! Instead, use it to clean your local commit history before merging it into a shared team branch. Remember this mantra, **NEVER REBASE PUSHED COMMITS!**

### Workflow üçÉ‡ºÑ
#### Step 1: Determine the Base Commit
1. **How far do you want to go?**
   - Decide which commit you want to start from, at least the ancestor or parent of the commit you want to change.

2. **Choose the Base Commit**:
   - Use `git log` or `git log --oneline` to find the appropriate commit hash or relative reference.
   
     ```
     git log --oneline
     ```

#### Step 2: Start the Interactive Rebase
1. **Run the Command**:
   - Start the interactive rebase with one of the following commands:

     ```
     git rebase --interactive HEAD~3
     ```
     OR
     ```
     git rebase -i HEAD~3
     ```
     OR
     ```
     git rebase -i <hash>
     ```

#### Step 3: Choose Actions in the Editor
1. **Editor Opens**:
   - A text editor will open, listing commits from the base commit to the HEAD.
   
2. **Determine Actions**:
   - For each commit, specify the action to perform:
     - `pick`: Use the commit as is (default).
     - `reword`: Change the commit message.
     - `edit`: Amend the commit content.
     - `squash`: Combine this commit with the previous one, merging messages.
     - `fixup`: Combine with the previous commit, discarding this commit's message.
     - `drop`: Remove the commit entirely.

3. **Example**:
   ```
   pick abc123 Commit message 1
   reword def456 Commit message 2
   edit ghi789 Commit message 3
   ```

4. **Save and Close**:
   - Save the file and close the editor to proceed.

#### Step 4: Execute Actions
1. **Reword Commit Messages**:
   - If `reword` was chosen, Git will prompt you to edit the commit message. Update the message, save, and close.

2. **Edit Commit Content**:
   - If `edit` was chosen, Git will pause the rebase. Make your changes, stage them, and amend the commit:
     
     ```
     git add <file>
     git commit --amend
     ```
   - Continue the rebase:
     
     ```
     git rebase --continue
     ```

3. **Resolve Conflicts** (if any):
   - If conflicts arise, resolve them manually, then stage the resolved files:
     
     ```
     git add <file>
     ```
   - Continue the rebase:
     
     ```
     git rebase --continue
     ```
   - To abort the rebase if needed:
     
     ```
     git rebase --abort
     ```

#### Step 5: Finalize and Verify
1. **Completion**:
   - Once all commits are processed, the rebase completes successfully.
     
2. **Review History**:
   - Check the updated commit history to ensure everything is as expected:
     
     ```
     git log --oneline
     ```

#### Additional Tips:
- **Backup Branch**: Before rebasing, create a backup branch for safety:
  
  ```
  git branch backup-branch
  ```
  
- **Rebase Shared History**: Be cautious when rebasing commits that have been shared with others. Coordinate with your team to avoid issues.

## Important Points ‚ö†

1. Suppose you create a branch, say `my-branch` and you work on this and do not commit the changes and try to switch to some other branch, say `main` you may loose the changes you made on `my-branch`. Commit your changes before switching branches!
